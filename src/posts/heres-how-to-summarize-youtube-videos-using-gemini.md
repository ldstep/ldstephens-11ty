Hey friends, I just discovered that Google's [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) can summarize YouTube videos. This isn't something that I would do all that often but it could come in handy on occasion so I thought I would share it with you.

If you're not familiar with Gemini it's a large language model Developed by Google AI similar to ChatGPT.

Here's how it works:

1. Find your target video
2. Copy the video URL
3. Head to [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/)
4. Paste the copied YouTube video URL into the prompt field on the Gemini page. Then, type a clear instruction like “Summarize this video” or “What are the key points of this video?”
5. Click submit and wait a few seconds. Gemini will analyze the video (using captions) and present you with a summary.

So, the next time you find a YouTube video that piques your interest but time is tight, give Gemini a try.
