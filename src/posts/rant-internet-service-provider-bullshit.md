I’m writing this because I need to get it off my chest. When we moved to New Jersey seven years ago, we got our internet service through Optimum. They had an attractive price for the first year. After that, you go to whatever the current standard price happens to be at the time. Every year since, I’ve had to call and renegotiate a price for the next 12 months.

For the last several years, our price has been $64.99 per month for 1 Gig. Occasionally the negotiations are simple, and they just roll over the previous pricing, but most times, it’s a real pain in the ass. Well, yesterday was one of those times.

After haggling with the agent for about 30 minutes, we arrived at a price that was reasonable but not what I wanted but okay. It required replacing the old cable with new fiber optic cable. The agent wanted me to schedule the appointment for the install, but I told him I needed to speak with my wife since she works from home and can’t be disconnected from the internet. I explained that I’d have to call back to schedule an appointment that worked for her.

This is where things went sideways. The agent said the offer was only valid while we were on the phone and that I needed to agree and schedule the appointment right then. That’s when the shit hit the fan. I told the agent that I didn’t appreciate being put in the position of having to make a decision like that and that I wouldn’t. I told the agent that Optimum could stick their deal where the sun don’t shine. Good bye!

My next move was to sign into my Verizon Wireless account on my iPhone and sign up for FIOS. The price was $64.99 per month for 1 Gig with a 4-year price guarantee. I signed up scheduled my install appointment for a time that worked for my wife, and I didn’t have to talk to anyone. Now that’s the way I like it. I should have done this years ago.

Okay, I feel better now that I’ve said my piece.
