I've been using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), and [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) for productivity and automation. Today it occurred to me that this is fucking silly! Why use three apps when I can do it all with one? With Alfred's built-in Features and 16 Workflows, I can do everything that I was doing in three.

Don't get me wrong, Keyboard Maestro and Raycast are both wonderful apps. Buy I've realized that I don't need them any longer.
