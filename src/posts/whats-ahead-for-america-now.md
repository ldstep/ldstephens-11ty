I went to bed at my normal time last night. I didn't want to stay up and watch the election results come in. I expected a Harris win. I didn't want to be stressed watching the results come in. I figured I would just get the results when I woke up this morning. Harris didn't win. Trump won the electoral college and it's looking like the popular vote as well.

As a result of this election, the United States will become a different kind of country. We have a Republican-controlled Supreme Court, Senate, and perhaps the House as well. With that, the Republicans will be unconstrained with their agenda.

The big question is will we be better off or worse off after another four years of Trump?
