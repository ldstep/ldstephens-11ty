Most iPhone and iPad users are familiar with the option to change font size in Mail, Contacts, Calendar, Phone, Notes, and other apps that support Dynamic Type. To do this, simply go to Settings \> Display & Brightness, then choose Text Size and use the slider to select your preferred font size. However, many might not know how to adjust font size in an individual app.

Yesterday, I encountered a situation where I needed to change the font size in a specific app that utilizes Dynamic Type. I wanted to modify the font size in [Goodnotes](https://www.goodnotes.com/) without affecting other apps. It took me a few minutes to recall the process, but you can indeed change font size for individual apps on your iPhone or iPad by following these steps:

1. Open the app for which you want to change the font size.
2. Open the Control Center by swiping down from the top-right corner of your screen. For iPhones with a Home button, swipe up from the bottom of the screen.
3. Tap the Text Size icon.
4. If the All Apps icon is blue, tap the \[This App\] Only icon.
5. Use your finger to move the slider up or down to change the font size for the app.

The more white bars, the larger the font size. Look at the top of the screen for a preview of the actual size of the font.

I hope this helps!
