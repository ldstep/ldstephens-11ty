Hey friends, have you ever wanted to scan a document and have it scan to “text” instead of PDF or JPEG? Well, now you can with Simple Scan.

[Simple Scan](https://agiletortoise.com/simple-scan/) by Greg Pierce of Agile Tortoise is a portable scanner app for iPhones. It allows you to capture high-quality scans of papers, receipts, and photos with just a few taps. You can save your scans as PDF or JPEG files and easily share them via email or cloud services. In addition to PDF or JPEG with [version 5](https://agiletortoise.com/simple-scan/changelog) you can now **scan to text** “_“Text” format option shares on the text recognized by optical character recognition as plain text. This can be output to a text file, or shared to other applications as text._“

I have a workflow where I can scan a document to “text” and share it directly into [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) Greg's other great app.

Check it out.
