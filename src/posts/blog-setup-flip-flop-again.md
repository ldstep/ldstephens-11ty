Yesterday, I decided to change the layout and design of this blog. Since it's a static site running on Netlify, making changes isn't always smooth. And, of course, I ended up breaking the fucking site.

So today, I had to point the DNS back to Bearblog, where I keep a duplicate version for moments like this when I inevitably mess up the static site.

For now (and maybe longer, depending on how things go), the blog is running on Bearblog until I get the new layout and design sorted.
