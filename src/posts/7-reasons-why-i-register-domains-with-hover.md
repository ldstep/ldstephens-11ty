After many years of using GoDaddy, I registered my first domain with[Hover](https://hover.com/uVPu2FkM) in 2016. By the way, I'm pretty sure I heard about Hover on an MPU podcast years ago. Anyway, having my domains with Hover has been an unbelievably good experience. Here's why.

1. A simple domain management experience.
2. Hundreds of domain extensions to choose from.
3. Free Whois Privacy to protect my contact information.
4. Powerful domain management tools.
5. No upselling.
6. No spam. Hover only sends me a reminder when my domains are about to expire. That's it. No unwanted emails.
7. Phone, chat, and email support.

So if you are looking for a better domain registration service to register your domains, don't hesitate. Register your next domain with Hover. And please use my [link](https://hover.com/uVPu2FkM) so I get credit. This helps support this blog and costs you nothing extra.

Full disclosure: I'd still recommend them even if they didn't have an affiliate program.
