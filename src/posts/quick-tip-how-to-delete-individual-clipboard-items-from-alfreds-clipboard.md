[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is the most used app on my Mac. Over the years I've written several articles about how I use it [here](https://ldstephens.net/?s=alfred).

I use Alfred's built-in [Clipboard History](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/clipboard/) and occasionally I want to delete a specific clipboard item. I couldn't figure out how to do it or if I even could. I googled for an answer and found that Fn + Backspace will delete individual items. Okay, where and the hell is the Backspace key on a Mac keyboard? I'm sure that 99.9% of you probably already know the answer but I didn't. The Backspace key on a Mac is the Delete key. So to delete an individual clipboard history item in Alfred you use Fn + Backspace (delete key).

Maybe this post will be helpful for another Alfred user.
