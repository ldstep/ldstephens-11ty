Hey friends, I tried Apple Intelligence on my iPhone, but honestly, I don’t see the point. The way I use my iPhone, it didn’t really add anything useful, and it seemed to drain the battery faster, so I turned it off.

I’ve kept it turned on on my MacBook for now, but based on my early impressions, it’s still not on par with ChatGPT.
