I just read Jack Bay’s post [From Hugo to Ghost and back again](https://baty.net/2024/12/from-hugo-to-ghost-and-back-again/) about how often he switches up his blogging engine.

> I can hear you all giggling. Ha ha very funny, Jack changed his blog again. I get it. Most normal people don’t change blogging engines every month or two.\[…\] Also, and maybe most importantly, I prefer static websites. The arguments in favor of static websites are enough, but they aren’t why I want a static site. It *feels* better having a static website. The actual publishing part can be a pain in the ass (:::cough::, Hugo) but the results are worth it. A folder full of HTML files and some images, starting on my local drive and synced to a simple web server…mmmmm, yummy.

This reminds me a bit of myself. You may have noticed that after switching this blog to a static site, I’ve moved it back to Bearblog and then back to static a couple of times over the last few weeks. Much like Jack, it just feels better to have a static website. I take pride in something I’ve built, and my content isn’t locked inside Bear.

And yes, I agree – publishing with a static site is a pain in the ass, but it’s worth the extra effort.

To stop the constant switching, I decided to close my Bear account. In the end, this entire site is just a folder full of HTML files on my SSD, synced to GitHub and hosted on Netlify.
