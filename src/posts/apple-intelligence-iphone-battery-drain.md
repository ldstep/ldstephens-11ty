Hey friends, I’ve recently noticed that my iPhone 15 Pro Max battery is draining faster than usual. I thought. Is this just me? Definitely not. [A lot of people](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-battery-drain.2442119/) are discussing this issue after enabling Apple Intelligence. For now, I’ve disabled it because I don’t find it particularly useful on my iPhone. After disabling Apple Intelligence my battery life is back to what it was before enabling it.
