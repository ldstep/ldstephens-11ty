Home Depot is gradually rolling out Apple Pay support, according to reports from [Chance Miller at 9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/08/home-depot-apple-pay-support/) readers and social media. While the company hasn’t officially commented, the rollout started in select stores over the summer and has recently expanded.

I haven’t been to Home Depot in a couple of weeks, so I’m not sure if our local store has it yet, but I’ll definitely check. Apple Pay is my go-to, and we buy a ton of shit from Home Depot. It’s always frustrating when I can’t use Apple Pay at checkout.
