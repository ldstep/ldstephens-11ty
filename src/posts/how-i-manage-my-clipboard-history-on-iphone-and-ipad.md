Hey friends, I was hoping for a clipboard manager in iOS and iPadOS 18. But we didn’t get one. This was no big deal for me because, though. I’ve had a clipboard history manager for iOS since, I think, around 2018 or 2019.

I know you’re thinking, how is that possible? It’s a little-known clipboard monitoring feature in [Yoink](https://eternalstorms.at/yoink/ios/). I can’t tell you how handy it is to have a clipboard history available, particularly when I’m using my iPad.

Yoink leverages Picture-in-Picture (PiP) to secretly monitor your clipboard. This lets it stay active even when you close the app. To activate clipboard monitoring, tap the "+" button, then "Monitor Clipboard," and select a timeout or "No Timeout." You'll need to confirm your choice.

If this interests you, Federico Viticci has a [detailed post](https://www.macstories.net/ios/yoink-brings-background-clipboard-monitoring-to-ios-and-ipados-15-via-picture-in-picture-workaround/#:~:text=Specifically%2C%20Yoink%20uses%20Apple's%20Picture,save%20it%20into%20the%20main) explaining how it works and how to set it up.
