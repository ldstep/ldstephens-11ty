Hey friends, I have Gary’s [MacMost Mac Video Tutorials and Tips](https://macmost.com/) in my RSS feed and the other day I saved this video [10 Things You Didn’t Know You Could Do With Just the Keyboard](https://macmost.com/10-things-you-didnt-know-you-could-do-with-just-the-keyboard.html) in Goodlinks to watch later. Well, I finally got around to watching it. By the way, if you love the Mac, MacMost is a great resource for tons of tutorials on how to use your Mac better.

This video highlights hidden macOS tricks for text navigation and selection using the keyboard. Here’s the gist:

-  Use the arrow keys to move the text cursor back and forth.
-  Hold the **Shift key** while using the arrow keys to select text:
-  **Shift + Right Arrow** selects one character at a time.
-  You can type, replace, or paste over the selected text.
-  Use the **Option key** for word-based movement:
-  **Option + Right/Left Arrow** jumps by word.
-  Add **Shift** to select one word at a time (**Shift + Option + Right/Left Arrow**).
-  Use the **Up/Down Arrow keys** to navigate vertically:
-  Add **Shift** to select text while moving up or down.
-  **Option + Down Arrow** jumps by paragraph.
-  Add **Shift** to select paragraphs (**Shift + Option + Down Arrow**), and use **Down Arrow** repeatedly to select multiple paragraphs.

Check it out, you’ll probably pick up a few new tricks!
