Feeding time around here is no joke! We go through 100 pounds of cracked corn every week to keep the deer and wild turkeys happy as they wander our 10-acre property. Our place is actually a Certified Wildlife Habitat with the state of New Jersey, and we love all the creatures that call it home.

On top of that, we go through 40 pounds of birdseed for all the birds. Of course, the raccoon has figured out a little trickâ€”every night, it climbs the tree, hangs off the bird feeder, and dumps the seed just so it can feast. Smart little guy! I havenâ€™t spotted the groundhog yet this year, but Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll make an appearance soon.
