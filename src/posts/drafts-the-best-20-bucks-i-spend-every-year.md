Hey friends, I want to give a shout-out to [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/)! It’s the best $20 bucks I spend every year. I first installed Drafts in 2014, when it was only available on iOS. Then, in 2019, Drafts came to the Mac. Drafts is my all-time favorite app and is where every bit of text starts: blog ideas, random thoughts, notes, you name it.

Whenever I have an idea or a thought, I immediately open Drafts and save it. It’s my go-to for quick note-taking. I use it to outline, draft, and format all my blog posts in Markdown. I keep everything organized with tags and workspaces. It’s also my personal information dump; with its amazing search, Drafts serves as my central repository for all the random bits of info I collect. On top of that, I’ve set up custom actions that let me do just about anything with my text: sending it to other apps, emailing it, saving it as a file, formatting it, and more.

If you’ve never tried Drafts, you gotta give it a try. There’s a free version to get you started.
