I was surprised to [hear on the Today show](https://news.yahoo.com/lifestyle/wendys-start-testing-uber-style-094524758.html) this morning that Wendy's is planning to test a dynamic pricing model, also referred to as “surge pricing,” in 2025. This means the prices of menu items will fluctuate based on several factors.

-  Time of day: Prices might be higher during peak hours like lunch and dinner, and lower during off-peak times.
-  Location: Prices might be adjusted based on the specific location and its customer base or demand.
-  Overall demand: Similar to Uber's surge pricing, prices could increase if there's a sudden surge in demand for Wendy's food.

The idea of fast food implementing surge pricing is bullshit. While companies have the right to set their own prices, this approach is nothing more than fucking consumers. It effectively means “we charge extra when you need us most”! Surge pricing at every level is nothing more than ripping off the consumer.
