Hey friends, I want to share a great free app I discovered for Mac:[CustomShortcuts](https://www.houdah.com/customShortcuts/) by Houdah Software.

CustomShortcuts allows you to create, manage, and customize keyboard shortcuts for menu items in most Mac applications. This is particularly useful for frequently used menu items that don't have default shortcuts assigned.

Houdah also makes [HoudahSpot](https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/), a powerful alternative to Finder's search function.

Give CustomShortcuts a try!
