I bet you've been on a phone call you wanted to end and couldn't come up with a way to do it. A dropped call is the perfect solution!

You can simulate a dropped call on an iPhone by turning on Airplane Mode. This can be done through Control Center by swiping down from the top right corner of the display and tapping on the Airplane icon or through the Settings app by toggling the Airplane Mode switch. The Airplane Mode disconnects all cellular and network connections on your iPhone and results in an active call being dropped even though the reason for the drop was initiated by the user and not by poor service or network issues.

I just learned [this little trick](https://osxdaily.com/2023/02/08/how-fake-drop-call-iphone/) the other day and I thought I would share it.
