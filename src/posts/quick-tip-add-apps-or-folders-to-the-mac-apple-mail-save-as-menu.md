I wasn't aware of this feature and I'm guessing I'm not the only one so I thought I’d share how to add items to the Mac Apple Mail “Save as” menu. I’ve added GoodNotes, My Inbox, Apple Notes, and DEVONthink to this menu.

Here's how you do it, Select “Print” (Cmd+P) and then, “Edit Menu” and then add or delete apps or folders.
