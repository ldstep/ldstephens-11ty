I just read David Sparks' [blog post](https://www.macsparky.com/blog/2025/03/cotypist-ai-autocompletion-everywhere-on-your-mac/) about Cotypist, a new AI app that gives you autocompletion everywhere on your Mac. Iâ€™m trying it out. My initial worry is that it might clash with Apple's own inline predictions, since they both do the same thing. Right now, Cotypist's in beta and free for anyone who signs up. They're still working on how they'll charge for it later. If you want to know more, definitely check out David's post.
