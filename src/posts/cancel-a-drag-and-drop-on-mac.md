While walking this morning and listening to ATP episode 614, the subject of how to cancel a drag and drop came up again. Of course, [John Siracusa](https://hypercritical.co/about/) knew the answer. I didn’t. I was glad to learn the answer because there have been times that I have started a drag and drop to move files to a different folder, and for some reason, it gets fucked up (user error missing the target folder), and I always panic and want to end the drag and drop.

According to John, all you need to do is **use the escape key**. I tested it and it works.

Thanks, John!
