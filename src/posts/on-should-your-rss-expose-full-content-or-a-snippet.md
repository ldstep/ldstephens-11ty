Recently, I came across two insightful takes on how RSS feeds should be formatted—one from [Thomas Rigby](https://thomasrigby.com/posts/should-your-rss-expose-full-content-or-a-snippet/) and another from [Ashur Cabrera](https://multiline.co/mment/2023/12/let-an-rss-feed-be-a-reminder/). Both explore the pros and cons of offering full-text content versus just a snippet in RSS feeds, and their differing perspectives got me thinking about my own stance on the issue.

While I prefer full-text RSS feeds, my reading habits have changed. I used to consume everything directly within my RSS reader or Goodlinks. Now, for personal blogs, I use Goodlinks as a collection tool. I save articles I want to read and then use a quick swipe gesture to open them in my browser. This allows me to appreciate the blog's design and website structure, which I've come to enjoy.
