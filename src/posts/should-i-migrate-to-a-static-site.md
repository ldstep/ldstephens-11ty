Over the last year, I've become increasingly interested in static sites. This led me to learn some basic HTML and CSS with the goal of recreating my current Bearblog site (ldstephens) as a static site, potentially hosting it on GitHub Pages. I've already completed building the new version, so the next step would be migrating all my existing posts.

A major advantage of making this switch would be full ownership of my site, eliminating my dependency on Bearblog and its subscription. This would give me complete control over my content and hosting infrastructure.

However, I'm facing two main concerns about making this transition:

1. **RSS Feed Impact**: My primary concern is that changing the RSS feed URL would cause me to lose my current RSS followers, who make up the core of my audience.
2. **Broken Links**: While all old links would break after the migration, this is less concerning since I no longer receive significant traffic from search results. My readership primarily comes through RSS subscriptions.

I'd appreciate hearing from those who have undertaken similar migrations. What was your experience? How did you handle these challenges? Any insights would be valuable in helping me make this decision.
