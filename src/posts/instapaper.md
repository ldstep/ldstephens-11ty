Once upon a time, [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) was my go-to read-it-later app. Over the years it’s had a long and convoluted life some good and some not so good. During one of those not-so-good times, I switched to [Goodlinks](https://goodlinks.app/).

Lately, Instapaper has been getting a lot of attention so every time the app gets updated I install it to test it out. Today I got an email from the developer announcing version 9.1 so I installed it and I’m using it in place for Goodlinks for the time being. One of the things that I like about Instapaper is the way it integrates with [Reeder Classic](https://www.reederapp.com/classic/).

I’m not sure if I’ll continue using Instapaper, but if I do, the free version is sufficient for my needs.
