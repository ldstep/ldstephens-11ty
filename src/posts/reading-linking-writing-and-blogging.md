As someone who spends a considerable amount of time consuming and sharing information on the web, I understand the importance of optimizing the process. Fortunately, through the use of right tools and workflows, I have been able to streamline this process. So I thought I would share it with you today.

My workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Reading**: I Use [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feeds with [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/), [Reeder](https://www.reederapp.com/), and [Goodlinks](https://goodlinks.app/). Goodlinks is for reading-later.
2. **Linking**: Once I am ready to start capturing ideas and writing, I use [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/), a powerful app that allows me to quickly capture my thoughts and ideas.
3. **Writing**: Drafts is where I write and publish shorter posts, and for longer pieces, I export my ideas to [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). iA Writer lets me better organize and structure my content before publishing.

By using these tools and workflows, I have been able to reduce the time and effort it takes to stay informed and share information with you my faithful readers.
