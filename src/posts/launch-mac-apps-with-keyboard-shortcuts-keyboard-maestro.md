This morning as I sat down at my iMac to start my day, the first thing I did was launch [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/), [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/), [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/), and Safari. I do this using keyboard shortcuts. While doing this, it occurred to me that this isn’t the way most people launch apps on their Mac, so I want to share how I do this with you.

Using keyboard shortcuts lets you perform actions faster and more efficiently, cutting down on mouse and trackpad usage. So, how do I create these keyboard shortcuts? I do it using [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/). Within Keyboard Maestro I have a Group called Launch Apps. This is where all my launcher macros live. Here’s the launcher macro, which you can duplicate:![](https://i.imgur.com/MM6uVOx.png)Repeat this for all the apps that you would like to launch using a keyboard shortcut. If you create the macro the way I have, the hotkey will show and hide the app.

Tomorrow I’ll walk you through how to launch apps with keyboard shortcuts using [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).
