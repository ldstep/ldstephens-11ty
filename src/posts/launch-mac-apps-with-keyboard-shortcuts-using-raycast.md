I’ve written about launching Mac apps with keyboard shortcuts using [Keyboard Maestro](https://ldstephens.me/launch-mac-apps-with-keyboard-shortcuts-keyboard-maestro) and [Alfred](https://ldstephens.me/launch-mac-apps-with-keyboard-shortcuts-using-alfred) now here’s how to do it using [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/).

First launch Raycast (I use ⌥ spacebar). In the entry field type Extensions then select Applications from the Extensions list and for this example select Safari. Under the Hotkey tab, you’ll see Record Hotkey.

Click on the Safari Hotkey field and Record your keyboard shortcut. I used ⌥ S.

That’s it! From now typing ⌥ S will launch Safari.

Using keyboard shortcuts lets you perform actions faster and more efficiently, cutting down on mouse and trackpad usage.

By the way, if you’re not using Alfred you should be using Raycast. It does almost everything that Alfred does and it’s FREE.
