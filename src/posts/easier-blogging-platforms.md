The other day I came across David Kennedy’s blog and as I always do when I discover a new indie blog I read his About page and scanned his Archive for articles I might be interested in reading.

David’s [Easy Websites](https://davidakennedy.com/blog/easy-websites/) post was a response to a post by Giles Turnbull “[Make the indie web easier](https://gilest.org/indie-easy.html)”.

> We need more self-hosted platforms for personal publishing that *aren’t Wordpress*. And don’t point me to Hugo or Netlify or Eleventy or all those things - all of them are great, but none of them are simple enough. We need web publishing tools that do not require users to open the Terminal *at all*. And we need lots of them.

Like David, I agree with Giles. I’ve been blogging in some form for over 20 years. Most of that time on WordPress.com.

I used to love WordPress but in my opinion, it has become way too complicated to use for personal blogs. It’s especially complicated for someone just starting.

If you’re wanting to get started with a personal blog I recommend [Pika](https://pika.page/). I also like [Bear](https://bearblog.dev/) but it is a little more technical to get started.
