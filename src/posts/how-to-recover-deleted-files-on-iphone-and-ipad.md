Have you accidentally deleted a file on your iPhone or iPad? It can be super frustrating, especially if the file was important. But don't worry, it's super easy to recover deleted files using the Recently Deleted feature in the Files app.

Recently Deleted in the Files app is kinda like the Trash on a Mac. When you delete a file, it goes into the Recently Deleted folder where it hangs out for 30 days before being permanently deleted. This gives you a chance to recover the file if you change your mind. When you delete a file, it goes into the Recently Deleted folder where it stays for 30 days before being permanently deleted. This gives you a chance to recover the file if you change your mind.

1. Open the Files app and tap on “Browse”
2. Tap on “Recently Deleted” under “Locations”
3. Tap on the deleted file you want to recover
4. Tap on “Recover”

One thing to keep in mind is that you only have 30 days to recover a deleted file before it is permanently deleted. If you don't see the file in the Recently Deleted folder, it may have already been deleted permanently.

Losing a file can be a stressful experience, but with the Recently Deleted feature in the Files app, you can recover your deleted files with ease. Just remember to check the Recently Deleted folder within 30 days of deleting the file. By following these simple steps, you'll never have to worry about losing an important file on your iPhone or iPad again.
