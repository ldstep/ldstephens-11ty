It's been a little over a month since we got our [Sleep Number i8](https://www.sleepnumber.com/categories/mattresses-innovation-series?tab=config) bed. We needed a new mattress and had heard positive reviews about Sleep Number beds. They are known for improving sleep quality, reducing back pain, and alleviating snoring.

It's been a game changer for my lower back. Before, I'd wake up stiff and hunched over, but now I get out of bed feeling good. That alone makes the investment worthwhile.

The snore setting? Eh, not as impressive. It's supposed to adjust the bed to help with snoring, but we haven't noticed much difference.

Everything is controlled by the Sleep Number app on our iPhones. No messing with buttons or remotes, just open the app and adjust. The sleep tracking is a nice bonus, too. It gives solid stats on how well (or not) you slept, which has been interesting to see.

Overall, we're happy with it.
