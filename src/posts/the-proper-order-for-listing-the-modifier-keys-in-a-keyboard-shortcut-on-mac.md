If you write about Mac keyboard shortcuts, as I do there’s a proper order for listing the modifier keys in a shortcut.

[Dr. Drang](https://leancrew.com/all-this/2017/11/modifier-key-order/)

> The proper order is similar to how you see them down at the bottom left of your keyboard.
>
> Control (⌃), Option (⌥), and Command (⌘) always go in that order. The oddball is the Shift(⇧) key, which sneaks in just in front of Command.
>
> Keyboard Maestro recognizes this standard order and presents its “hot key” shortcut the same way.
