As a newcomer with little or no HTML or CSS experience, you're going to need guidance building your static site. While YouTube videos and Google searches offer fragmented advice, I found a more comprehensive approach using [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/new).

Claude helped me develop HTML and CSS templates. It provided accurate, actionable, and tailored advice that addressed my specific development needs. Claude transformed complex web development concepts into digestible, actionable steps. It also recommended using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for coding and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting and walked me through setting it up via GitHub.

You can do the same thing with ChatGPT but I found Claude to be more precise and helpful.
