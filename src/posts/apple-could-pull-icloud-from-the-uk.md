Hey friends, I know many of you who read my posts are in the U.K. You may have already read this. Quoting [Tim Hardwick, MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/could-apple-pull-icloud-services-from-uk/) *“A more dramatic response from Apple would involve completely removing iCloud services from the UK. While this would protect Apple's encryption standards, it would severely disrupt millions of UK users who rely on iCloud for photo storage, device backups, and document syncing. Users would need to find alternative cloud storage solutions and potentially lose access to years of accumulated data.”* Are you concerned about this possibility?
