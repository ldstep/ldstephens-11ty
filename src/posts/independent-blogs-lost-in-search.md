I've been posting on [Medium](https://ldstephens.medium.com/) since 2015, and recently, I've noticed a significant increase in views. This uptick seems to be related to Google's shift towards AI-powered search results.

Google's new search algorithm prioritizes content from platforms like Medium, Reddit, Stack Overflow, and Quora over traditional independent blogs. In the end, this trend is pretty fucking disheartening for independent bloggers.

It feels like the unique, personal space of an independent blog is getting lost in the noise of the big platforms. For those of us who value independent blogging, it’s a frustrating reminder that the rules of visibility online keep shifting and not in our favor.
