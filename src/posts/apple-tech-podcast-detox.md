As I’ve gotten older, I've been simplifying my life in various ways. But one area still needs work: my technology addiction.

Over the years, I’ve built the perfect tech stack apps, devices, and automations all setup just like I want them. I’m no longer interested in tinkering with new apps; it’s a waste of time and money. And I’m definitely not interested in being told I need a Mac to get real work done when my iPad works just fine. Frankly, that’s bullshit! That said I prefer my MacBook.

These external pressures come from the Apple tech podcasts I’ve been listening to for years. But I’m done being influenced. So, I’m cutting the influencers:

-  Mac Power Users
-  Automators
-  Upgrade
-  Connected
-  iPad Pros
-  ATP
