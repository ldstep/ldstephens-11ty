> No matter the case, ads on the web will always be tricky and live in this bizarre gray area. And until someone comes up with a really compelling argument for allowing ads I'll keep running ad-blockers because I just can't stand ads.

Ah, web ads, the unsolicited guests that never fucking leave. I have been using an ad-blocker since they were first available to consumers. My blocker of choice for Safari is [Wiper](https://kaylees.site/wipr.html) and [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) for Firefox.

As a side note, I'm also annoyed by websites that bug me with a popup to sign to receive their email. You know who you are so stop it already.
