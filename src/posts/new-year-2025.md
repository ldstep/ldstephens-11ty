Here we are again - another year has flown by! They seem to go by faster and faster, and 2024 was no exception. It’s hard to believe we’re already in 2025.

While I’m not one to dwell too much on the past, I will say that 2024 was a good year for Lisa and me. Looking ahead, my hope for 2025 is to continue living a healthy lifestyle and making the most of each day. I’ve got a couple of significant milestones coming up this year, which I’ll likely share more about when the time comes.

Happy New Year, and thank you for being a reader!
