Hey friends, building this site has been a several-month project. I had a lot of stops and starts, but in the end, I persevered and it’s finally finished.

This blog is built using static [HTML and CSS](https://htmlforpeople.com/) and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). It automatically deploys when I commit changes to the [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/ldstep/ldstephens).

When adding new posts, changing the design, or adding new features, that is done in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

New posts are written in Markdown in [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/) and copied as HTML to add to a new post in VS Code.
