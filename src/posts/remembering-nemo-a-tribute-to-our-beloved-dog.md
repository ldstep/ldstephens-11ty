Today marks the ninth anniversary of our dog Nemo’s passing. Nemo was an amazing dog who enriched our lives in so many ways. When we first adopted him, we were told that he had been at the shelter for about a year and had been adopted a few times and returned. It was clear that Nemo was meant to be with us, and I’m so grateful that I got to be his human.

In October 2013, I noticed that Nemo was having trouble with his balance when he lifted his leg to pee. He eventually lost his balance and would fall over, so I took him to the vet. He was diagnosed with degenerative myelopathy, a terrible disease that slowly degenerates the spinal cord. Nemo’s condition worsened over time, and it was heartbreaking to see him lose his muscle strength, stumble, and eventually become incontinent.

In April 2014, we made the difficult decision to let Nemo go. It was a painful decision, but we knew that it was the right thing to do for our beloved dog. With vet assistance, Nemo passed away on Saturday, April 19th, 2014. I still fucking miss him every day, but we take comfort in knowing that he is in a better place now, running and playing with Tonka and Lola.
