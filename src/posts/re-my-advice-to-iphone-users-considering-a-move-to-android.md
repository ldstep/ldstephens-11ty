I’ve noticed that some bloggers I follow are switching from iOS to Android. I’m sure each of them has their reasons for doing so.

I moved from Android to iOS 10 years ago. Android has probably changed a lot since then, but I don’t see myself ever returning. I left Android because I wanted to stop using Google services. In addition, iOS offered better security and privacy, and consistent OS updates.

[MereCivilian](https://merecivilian.com/my-advice-to-iphone-users-considering-a-move-to-android/) recently switched to Android and offers some good advice for those who may be considering the switch. As I mentioned above, I stopped using Google services long ago and wouldn’t want to start again, which would be necessary with an Android phone.
