> With the Apple Intelligence and Siri delays, people have speculated on why it’s late. Maybe it’s about [getting the security right](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/8/delaying-personalized-siri/). Maybe it’s just buggy and taking longer than expected.[…] But what if Apple has discovered that it’s _not actually possible_? AI is entirely new, with new requirements that stress the limits of hardware. Apple is attempting to cram a clever intermingling of data and Siri features into 8 GB of RAM. As a comparison, the largest version of DeepSeek R1 [can only be run on a brand new Mac Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4qwuCXyAcU) with the M3 Ultra and 512 GB of RAM.

That’s an interesting thought.
