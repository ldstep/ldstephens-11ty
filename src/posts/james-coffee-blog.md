Hey friends, the other day, I was reading a blog post (wish I could remember whose!) about the indie web. It had several links, and I clicked one that took me to [indieweb.org](https://indieweb.org/). While browsing there, I stumbled upon [James’ Coffee Blog](https://jamesg.blog/).

What really hooked me was James’ content. It’s a mix of tech and personal topics. I spent some time exploring his site and found tons of interesting articles to dive into. Needless to say, James’ Coffee Blog is now part of my RSS feed!

If you’re not already following James, check out his site. I think you’ll find it worthwhile.

This is something that I highlighted while reading one of his [posts](https://jamesg.blog/2025/01/15/static-dynamic/).

If my publishing tool goes down for any reason, my static site can still be available. I enjoy having folders of text files to edit: both markdown for posts and HTML for templates.

I couldn’t agree more, static sites offer speed, simplicity, and the satisfaction of working directly with text files!
