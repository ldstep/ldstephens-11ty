There are times when I'm doing something in Safari, like research, and have a lot of tabs open. Sometimes I would like to have a list of all those open tabs. Well, this is where this workflow comes in. [Robb Knight has written an Alfred workflow that does exactly that.](https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows/tree/main/workflows/safari-tabs-markdown#what-does-it-do)

Here's what it does. It copies open tabs from Safari in various formats:

-  Copy current tab or all
-  Choose which of the pages to copy if copying all
-  Copy as:
   -  Markdown
   -  Markdown list
   -  Titles only
   -  Links only
   -  Titles and links

The keyword trigger is `sf`

You can download the workflow [here](https://github.com/rknightuk/alfred-workflows/tree/main/workflows/safari-tabs-markdown)

Robb also has other Alfred workflows that you may be interested in and you can check them out here: [Robb Knight – Alfred Workflows](https://rknight.me/alfred-workflows/)
