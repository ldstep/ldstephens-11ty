The "iPhone Maybe Too Close" notification is part of the Screen Distance feature introduced in iOS 17. This feature aims to reduce eye strain by reminding users to keep their iPhone at least 12 inches from their eyes. Once disabled, your iPhone will no longer remind you to move it away from your eyes.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

To disable:

1. Open Settings app
2. Go to Screen Time
3. Select Screen Distance
4. Toggle off the feature
