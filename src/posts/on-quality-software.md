[Nicolas Magand](https://thejollyteapot.com/2024/03/9/on-quality-software) *“The other day, I was getting frustrated with the iCloud sync of my RSS feeds in NetNewsWire. It works OK. It syncs between my phone and my computer, what else could I want? Well, it was a bit too slow for my taste, and not 100% reliable, so I subscribed to Feedbin just to make it smoother. It was not about convenience or efficiency, really; it was just about the details.”*

Just yesterday I subscribed to Feedbin for the same reason. Besides offering a smoother experience, Feedbin keeps everything in sync across different apps. This means I can use Feedbin with NetNewsWire on my MacBook and Reeder on my iPhone and iPad, and my feed will always be up-to-date.
