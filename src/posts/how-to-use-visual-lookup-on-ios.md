Visual Lookup is a handy tool that you can use to identify and learn about plants, trees, insects, wildlife, pets, and more. I knew that there are apps for that but I didn’t know the iOS built-in camera also does it.

I often see a plant, tree, animal, or bug on our property and wonder what it is. Now I know how to identify it.

Steps:

1. Take a photo of the object that you want to identify.
2. Go to the Photos app and open the image you want to identify.
3. Look for the info button. It looks like a small “i” or a star. It’s typically located at the bottom of the screen.
4. Tap the info button. This will display details about the photo.
5. Tap Look Up. This option will appear at the top of the photo information.
6. Visual Lookup will provide information about the identified object, such as its name, species, or relevant details.
