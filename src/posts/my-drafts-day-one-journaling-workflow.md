Sparky and Stephen's deep dive into journaling on the [Mac Power Users podcast episode 762](https://overcast.fm/+FrCG3vauU): got me thinking about how I approach this practice. So I thought I would chime in with how I journal.

Here's my workflow:

-  **Quick capture with Drafts:** I use Drafts to write my text entries, it's perfect for capturing fleeting thoughts or brain dumps.
-  **Monthly organization:** My [Drafts Monthly Journal](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Zk) keeps everything neatly organized, month by month.
-  **End-of-month migration:** At the month's end, I seamlessly [share the entire journal with Day One](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/2Gs), preserving my reflections for posterity.
-  **Day One:** I use Day One to add images to my journal. I use it on my iPhone to take photos or import them from my camera roll.
-  **Daily dose of nostalgia:** Day One's “On This Day” feature is my daily dose of happy memories and self-reflection.
