The other day, I [wrote](https://ldstephens.me/re-the-wonderful-rabbit-hole-of-bbedit/) about the wonderful rabbit hole of BBEdit and how I now have it set for writing markdown except for one item:

> (Shit, I have to figure out how to end a sentence with double space for the period. That is a hard fucking habit to break.)

I got an email from MacOSX Guru suggesting that he does that with a Keyboard Maestro macro. I probably should have asked him for his macro, but instead, I attempted to create my own and was successful. The macro is triggered by double-tapping the spacebar which executes insert text "." by typing.
