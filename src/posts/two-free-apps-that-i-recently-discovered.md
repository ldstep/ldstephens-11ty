Hey friends, here are two free apps that I recently discovered and want to share with you:

-  [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/): is a tool for collecting and organizing code. As you generate a significant amount of code, youâ€™ll begin to see its value. When I first started experimenting with AI code generation for building my static site, SnippetsLab was incredibly valuable.

-  [Samurai Search](https://samarama.net/samuraisearch/): iOS search is shit, especially when you want to search within a file. With Samurai can search source code, plain text files, and PDF files on your iOS device or in iCloud. You can also preview matched files or open them in your preferred editing or viewing application.
