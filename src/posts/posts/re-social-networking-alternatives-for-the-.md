I saw this [Verge article](https://www.theverge.com/23429095/twitter-social-network-alternatives-mastodon-reddit-tumblr-cohost) in my RSS feed about alternatives for the Meta- and Musk-averse and wondered if blogging was provided as an alternative. Well, you probably guessed blogging was not provided as an alternative—just more social media platforms. Look folks maybe it’s time to quit social media and start a blog. If what you’re using isn’t already enshittified it will be.
