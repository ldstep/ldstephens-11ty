I updated my iPhone to iOS 18.2 the other day and was pissed to find my Mail app hijacked by the categories and giant sender icons. I was more pissed that the update just forced these changes on me without even asking if I wanted these shitty[1](https://ldstephens.me/posts/apples-unwanted-182-mail-makeover#fn:1) new features.

After fucking around for a while, I figured out how to turn these annoying new features off and return to the Mail interface that’s worked perfectly fine forever.

To disable sender icons, follow these steps:

-  Open the Settings app on your iPhone
-  Scroll down and tap “Apps”
-  Find and tap “Mail”
-  Locate the “Message List” section
-  Toggle off the switch next to “Show Contact Photos”

To disable categories, follow these steps:

-  Open the Mail app on your iPhone
-  Tap the “More” button (three dots) in the upper right corner of your inbox
-  Select “List View” from the pop-up menu
