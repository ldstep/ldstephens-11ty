The other day I saved an article to [Goodlinks](https://goodlinks.app/) to read later. Today I decided to read it and discovered that the article is a 33 minute read. I didn’t want to take the time to read it right then, I thought that’s something that I would like to read on my Kindle Paperwhite while I’m in bed this evening[1](https://ldstephens.me/posts/send-articles-from-iphone-to-kindle-for-reading-later#fn1-27410). The next question is how the hell do I get this article on my Kindle?

It was easy. I opened the article on my iPhone and saved it to my Kindle via the share sheet save to Kindle. I wrote this to share a helpful tip I didn’t know about myself. If you’re interested in doing the same thing, I hope you find it useful!
