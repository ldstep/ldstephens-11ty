Did you know that [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14726057) has folders that will auto-purge emails? This feature allows you to automatically delete messages from a folder after a certain amount of time. I’ve found that this is a great way to manage notification emails that I want to keep but not forever.

To set up a folder with auto-purge, just follow these simple steps:

1. Go to the **Settings** page in Fastmail.
2. Click on the **Folders** tab.
3. Find the folder that you want to set up auto-purge for.
4. Click on the **Edit** button.
5. Scroll down to the **Automated Actions** section.
6. Check the box next to **Auto-purge this folder on a selected date**.
7. Select the number of days after which you want the messages to be deleted.
8. Click on the **Save** button.

That's it! Once you've set up a folder with auto-purge, any messages that are older than the specified number of days will be automatically deleted.
