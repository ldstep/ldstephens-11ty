The other day I wondered if an iPhone could be a person's only computer. After doing a little research I discovered that with iPhone 15 Pro using USB C, it could be.

The iPhone 15 Pro can handle many tasks with the right setup. Here's how to turn your iPhone 15 Pro into a more computer-like machine. With its USB-C port, the iPhone 15 Pro can be transformed into a computer by connecting a keyboard, mouse, and external monitor. With a USB-C dongle, you can add additional storage space.

If this has made you curious I recommend watchingÂ [this video by Stephen Robles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RWQ_pmIRTo). This is pretty fucking cool but I'll be sticking with my M1 MacBook Air.
