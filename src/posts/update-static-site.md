First, a huge thank you to everyone who commented on my original post! After weighing the pros and cons, I've decided that BearBlog is where I'll stay.

I gave building my static site a solid shot, creating it in raw HTML and CSS. But upkeep, adding new posts, and updating the feed.xml every time was just too tedious and error-prone. Sure, a static site generator could've made things easier, but I found them too complex for me to fully get comfortable with.

Still, I learned a lot along the way, and it was absolutely worth the effort!
