Hey friends, I know many of you prefer mono fonts for writing and coding. I recently discovered a new mono-spaced font that you might be interested in. Macosguru [posted](https://bicycleforyourmind.com/links%20of%20note%202025-01-21) about a new text editor he found and also mentioned that the app’s default font, Zed mono, was clean and well-designed.

> [Zed](https://zed.dev/) is a new text editor which is built around the collaboration between humans and AI. I am not interested in that particular activity but it is an interesting addition to the world of text editors. It is snappy, clean, and modern. I don’t have a need for it, having immersed myself in Emacs. But if you are looking for an editor, I would give this a shot.

> Talking about Zed. I loved the fonts that the editor uses as default. They have made them available.[The Zed Mono and Sans typefaces, custom built from Iosevka](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed-fonts). I can’t resist a free font, specially a well-designed, clean one. Get them to use in your editor of choice.

Like Macosguru, I’m not interested in Zed’s text editor, but I did download the mono fonts. I’m currently typing this in MarkEdit using the Zed mono-spaced font, and I like it. I’m going to use it for a while and see if it sticks for me. Check out the Zed editor and Zed fonts for more information.
