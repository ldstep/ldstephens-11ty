> _Personal automation doesn’t need to involve expensive third party hardware, or require scripting. It can be something as as simple as [customizing keyboard shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/create-keyboard-shortcuts-for-apps-mchlp2271/mac) or defining [text replacement](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/replace-text-punctuation-documents-mac-mh35735/mac) macros.
