I was thinking about this today so I wanted to share it. [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) is where I capture everything except to-do items, which I capture in [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/). Anything related to text, except code, is done in Drafts. Once Iâ€™ve finished writing, I've created actions to send the text as a file to its final destination. Nothing remains in Drafts.
