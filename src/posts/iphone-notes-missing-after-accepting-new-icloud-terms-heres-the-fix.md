Hey friends, Apple recently updated their iCloud terms and conditions, and apparently, after accepting these new terms, [some iPhone users opened their Notes app to find all their notes gone](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/how-to-fix-iphone-notes-disappearing/)! Luckily, I didn’t experience this myself, but some people are having this issue, and I wanted to share a simple fix to help you get those notes back if you’re one of them.

The Fix:

1. Open the Settings app.
2. Tap your name at the top (Apple Account settings).
3. Select iCloud.
4. Tap Notes.
5. Ensure Sync this iPhone is on (toggle it off and back on if it’s already enabled).
6. Open the Notes app and wait a few minutes for your notes to reappear.
