<p>GoodLinks: &quot;GoodLinks 2.3 is out now! This update adds &quot;Recently Deleted&quot; list. Links are available for 30 days. After that time, links will be permanently deleted. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve deleted something after reading it, only to later want to refer back to it and have to waste time searching for it again. Fortunately, it will now be stored in the Recently Deleted folder for 30 days.</p>

<p>I had some fun playing around with 11ty in Glitch today. The only thing that really makes 11ty stand out from a regular static site with HTML and CSS is the ability to use Nunjucks templates.</p>
<p>This means you can make changes to your site by updating the template file, instead of having to manually edit every single file. It saves a lot of time! However, I'm not sure if rebuilding this particular site in 11ty would be worth the effort.</p>

<p>I’m wondering why I keep archives in Drafts for text that gets saved as files in folders elsewhere. It serves no purpose.</p>

<p>Apple Notes on iOS 18 now has a new feature called Recent Notes. It lets you quickly jump between the last 10 notes you looked at. This makes it much easier and faster for people with lots of notes, as you don’t need to dig through all your folders.</p>
<p>To access this feature, tap the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the app. You’ll see a Recent Notes option. Tap it to view the last 10 notes you checked out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abandoning Alfred for Raycast was hard, and it even took me two tries because it felt unthinkable, but Raycast is really good and wonderfully connected to other things I use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time I wrote, “I think I need to try again,” so I did. I reinstalled Raycast for the umpteenth time. Yesterday, I returned to Alfred. Raycast is undoubtedly a great app. If I were starting fresh with a launcher, it would be my top choice. However, having used Alfred for so long, I find it difficult to abandon it.</p>

<p>I’ll start sounding like a broken record but, at this point, I don’t care: social media was and still is a mistake. Enough people all bunched together in the same space with the ability to quickly interact with each other will produce more harm than good. And no, decentralising this crap won’t make it better. You can lie to yourself and pretend it will, but it won’t. But hey, I’ll be happy to be proven wrong.</p>

<p>It snowed here again last night and it’s fucking cold. As I write this, it’s about time to take Trix out for her afternoon walk and it’s only 25° and feels like 13°. We have three more days of this Arctic weather. I like the cold weather. Getting all bundled up in layers of my winter clothes.</p>

<p>Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) are putting pressure on big tech firms to explain their motives for donating to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund. In letters to Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Uber, the lawmakers express concerns about the companies making contributions to “avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy favor.”</p>

<p>When I set up my site, years ago, I made it insanely simple on purpose. As a developer, the only limit to what my site can do is basically my imagination and yet I decided to stick with just one layout, in a single column, with no navigation. There is no automation going on, in order to publish something I have to log in and manually copy-paste my content.</p>

<p>This morning, I got out early for my walk, hoping to beat the start of the snowstorm that’s bearing down on us. Well, I almost got it finished before the snow started falling.</p>
<p>January 4, 2025</p>
<p>After my fall down the basement stairs the other day, I decided that I need to work on improving my balance. Falling is problem when you’re a senior. Lisa encouraged me to start doing yoga. Today was my first workout. It made me realize how shitty my balance is!</p>

<p>It’s the first day of Winter, and we woke up to snow this morning. About 2 inches. Knowing that it was going to snow overnight, I was curious about how Trix (our dog) would like it or if she would. She loved it. It was fun to watch her run around, jump up and down, and eat the snow.</p>

<p>My tech stack plan for 2025 is files over apps and to use non-subscription apps where possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>File over app is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.</p>
<p>File over app is an appeal to tool makers: accept that all software is ephemeral, and give people ownership over their data.</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately.</p>
<p>December 3, 2024</p>
<p>What a novel idea: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposes stricter regulations on data brokers, requiring them to adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This would restrict brokers from selling sensitive data, like Social Security numbers, unless for legitimate purposes (e.g., credit eligibility). The move aims to protect against identity theft and scams, ensuring brokers follow consumer protection laws similar to credit bureaus. It may also reduce the scale of data sales, forcing some brokers out of business. The proposal has broad support despite not addressing data breaches directly.

<p>Whenever I change blogging platforms or domain names or simply post to several places, I feel a twinge of guilt. How will my “audience” feel about the changes? Does it confuse things?[…] I don’t get a lot of traffic, but it’s also not zero traffic, so I feel some responsibility. But why? I am not writing for money or influence or popularity. I write to better understand my thoughts, and sometimes share the result. I write so that I have a record of those things. I write, almost entirely, for me.[…] In that light, I shouldn’t need to worry about whether my RSS feed is consistent or if people need to follow me in too many places. I don’t want to be a dick about it, but c’mon, it’s an unimportant personal blog by some nobody on the internet. Let’s not overthink it.</p>
