    <h3>Notes</h3>
<p>Notes are shorter random posts, kinda like a microblog.</p>

<p>I’m wondering why I keep archives in Drafts for text that gets saved as files in folders elsewhere. It serves no purpose.</p>

<p>Apple Notes on iOS 18 now has a new feature called Recent Notes. It lets you quickly jump between the last 10 notes you looked at. This makes it much easier and faster for people with lots of notes, as you don’t need to dig through all your folders.</p>
<p>To access this feature, tap the three-dot menu in the top-right corner of the app. You’ll see a Recent Notes option. Tap it to view the last 10 notes you checked out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All of this is to point out that a loss of trust in society — trust in government, trust in institutions, trust in each other — is the cause of a break down and, if left uncorrected, end to that society. Period. There is no “but”. You can not have a society without it. Society rises and falls on the strength of it.</p>
<p>Consider where we are as a nation — a people — today and make of this fact what you will.</p>

<p>I’ll start sounding like a broken record but, at this point, I don’t care: social media was and still is a mistake. Enough people all bunched together in the same space with the ability to quickly interact with each other will produce more harm than good. And no, decentralising this crap won’t make it better. You can lie to yourself and pretend it will, but it won’t. But hey, I’ll be happy to be proven wrong.</p>

<p>It snowed here again last night and it’s fucking cold. As I write this, it’s about time to take Trix out for her afternoon walk and it’s only 25° and feels like 13°. We have three more days of this Arctic weather. I like the cold weather. Getting all bundled up in layers of my winter clothes.</p>

<p>Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) are putting pressure on big tech firms to explain their motives for donating to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund. In letters to Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Uber, the lawmakers express concerns about the companies making contributions to “avoid scrutiny, limit regulation, and buy favor.”</p>

<p>This morning, I got out early for my walk, hoping to beat the start of the snowstorm that’s bearing down on us. Well, I almost got it finished before the snow started falling.</p>

<p>It’s the first day of Winter, and we woke up to snow this morning. About 2 inches. Knowing that it was going to snow overnight, I was curious about how Trix (our dog) would like it or if she would. She loved it. It was fun to watch her run around, jump up and down, and eat the snow.</p>

<p>File over app is a philosophy: if you want to create digital artifacts that last, they must be files you can control, in formats that are easy to retrieve and read. Use tools that give you this freedom.</p>

<p>What a novel idea: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) proposes stricter regulations on data brokers, requiring them to adhere to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). This would restrict brokers from selling sensitive data, like Social Security numbers, unless for legitimate purposes (e.g., credit eligibility). The move aims to protect against identity theft and scams, ensuring brokers follow consumer protection laws similar to credit bureaus. It may also reduce the scale of data sales, forcing some brokers out of business. The proposal has broad support despite not addressing data breaches directly.

<p>Whenever I change blogging platforms or domain names or simply post to several places, I feel a twinge of guilt. How will my “audience” feel about the changes? Does it confuse things?[…] I don’t get a lot of traffic, but it’s also not zero traffic, so I feel some responsibility. But why? I am not writing for money or influence or popularity. I write to better understand my thoughts, and sometimes share the result. I write so that I have a record of those things. I write, almost entirely, for me.[…] In that light, I shouldn’t need to worry about whether my RSS feed is consistent or if people need to follow me in too many places. I don’t want to be a dick about it, but c’mon, it’s an unimportant personal blog by some nobody on the internet. Let’s not overthink it.</p>
