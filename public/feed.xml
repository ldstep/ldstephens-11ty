&lt;p&gt;Hey friends, building this site has been a several-month project. I had a lot of stops and starts, but in the end, I persevered and it’s finally finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog is built using static &lt;a href=&quot;https://htmlforpeople.com/&quot;&gt;HTML and CSS&lt;/a&gt; and is hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;. It automatically deploys when I commit changes to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ldstep/ldstephens&quot;&gt;public GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When adding new posts, changing the design, or adding new features, that is done in &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New posts are written in Markdown in &lt;a href=&quot;https://getdrafts.com/&quot;&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt; and copied as HTML to add to a new post in VS Code.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using AI to help you build your first static website</title>

&lt;p&gt;As a newcomer with little or no HTML or CSS experience, you&#39;re going to need guidance building your static site. While YouTube videos and Google searches offer fragmented advice, I found a more comprehensive approach using &lt;a href=&quot;https://claude.ai/new&quot;&gt;Claude AI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude helped me develop HTML and CSS templates. It provided accurate, actionable, and tailored advice that addressed my specific development needs. Claude transformed complex web development concepts into digestible, actionable steps. It also recommended using &lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;VS Code&lt;/a&gt; for coding and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.netlify.com/&quot;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; for hosting and walked me through setting it up via GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can do the same thing with ChatGPT but I found Claude to be more precise and helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mac tip - navigating and selecting text from the keyboard</title>

&lt;p&gt;Hey friends, I have Gary’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://macmost.com/&quot;&gt;MacMost Mac Video Tutorials and Tips&lt;/a&gt; in my RSS feed and the other day I saved this video &lt;a href=&quot;https://macmost.com/10-things-you-didnt-know-you-could-do-with-just-the-keyboard.html&quot;&gt;10 Things You Didn’t Know You Could Do With Just the Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; in Goodlinks to watch later. Well, I finally got around to watching it. By the way, if you love the Mac, MacMost is a great resource for tons of tutorials on how to use your Mac better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This video highlights hidden macOS tricks for text navigation and selection using the keyboard. Here’s the gist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the arrow keys to move the text cursor back and forth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold the &lt;strong&gt;Shift key&lt;/strong&gt; while using the arrow keys to select text:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shift + Right Arrow&lt;/strong&gt; selects one character at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can type, replace, or paste over the selected text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;strong&gt;Option key&lt;/strong&gt; for word-based movement:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option + Right/Left Arrow&lt;/strong&gt; jumps by word.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;strong&gt;Shift&lt;/strong&gt; to select one word at a time (&lt;strong&gt;Shift + Option + Right/Left Arrow&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;strong&gt;Up/Down Arrow keys&lt;/strong&gt; to navigate vertically:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;strong&gt;Shift&lt;/strong&gt; to select text while moving up or down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option + Down Arrow&lt;/strong&gt; jumps by paragraph.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;strong&gt;Shift&lt;/strong&gt; to select paragraphs (&lt;strong&gt;Shift + Option + Down Arrow&lt;/strong&gt;), and use &lt;strong&gt;Down Arrow&lt;/strong&gt; repeatedly to select multiple paragraphs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check it out, you’ll probably pick up a few new tricks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his Macworld article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macworld.com/article/2525708&quot;&gt;Jason Snell&lt;/a&gt; makes a strong argument for why the Mac’s software ecosystem should be the model for iOS and iPadOS. Unlike iOS’s strict, App Store-only model, macOS has a more flexible approach to software distribution that has a balance between security and user freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;App Store Apps: These are the most secure and Apple-approved, meeting strict standards. Macs can even be set to run only these apps, but it’s not the default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notarized Apps: Developers can distribute apps outside the App Store by submitting them for an automated Apple scan. These apps are safer than fully unverified software, as Apple’s cryptographic signature ensures they’re untampered and from known developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-Notarized Apps: These come with no Apple oversight, often from open-source or niche developers. While less secure, they’re still an option for users willing to take the risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system would let iOS and iPadOS users choose what they want without putting their safety at risk, just like Apple does on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cancel a drag and drop on Mac</title>

&lt;p&gt;While walking this morning and listening to ATP episode 614, the subject of how to cancel a drag and drop came up again. Of course, &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypercritical.co/about/&quot;&gt;John Siracusa&lt;/a&gt; knew the answer. I didn’t. I was glad to learn the answer because there have been times that I have started a drag and drop to move files to a different folder, and for some reason, it gets fucked up (user error missing the target folder), and I always panic and want to end the drag and drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to John, all you need to do is &lt;strong&gt;use the escape key&lt;/strong&gt;. I tested it and it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, John!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/POSSE&quot;&gt;POSSE&lt;/a&gt;? It stands for &amp;quot;Publish on your Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere&amp;quot; - basically where you post stuff on your site first, then share it around on social media and whatnot, always linking back to your original post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing is, I&#39;ve been wondering if I should be doing this. And for me, it&#39;s clearly no. Since I don&#39;t use social media, why would I want to put my blog posts there? Sure, maybe I&#39;d pick up a few more RSS subscribers, but that&#39;s not why I&#39;m blogging in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My blog is its own thing. It’s mainly just a place to get my thoughts out there. My RSS followers are my people, and I pick up new ones now and then when other bloggers link to something I wrote. And that’s perfectly fine with me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sticking My Head in the Sand (But Not Really)</title>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent way too much time over the last 12 months paying way too much &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; attention to political news. The US election is over. I’m over it. I’ve purged all news from my RSS feed, including any blogs that can’t resist regularly interjecting politics into their content. Gone. Done. Also? No more 24-hour news channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m old. I want to enjoy what’s left of this ride. I don’t want to spend my final years fretting about everything that’s coming down the pike that I don’t agree with. Do I care? Hell yes, I care. But let’s be real, there’s nothing I can do to change it. And let’s face it, nobody’s going to be thrilled with everything that’s coming anyway, no matter who you voted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, am I sticking my head in the sand? Nope. I’m still watching the national news on broadcast TV, you know, the regular stuff that gives me what I need to know without dragging me into the political abyss. I’ll stay informed, but the days of letting politics hijack my fucking sanity are over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed that some bloggers I follow are switching from iOS to Android. I’m sure each of them has their reasons for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I moved from Android to iOS 10 years ago. Android has probably changed a lot since then, but I don’t see myself ever returning. I left Android because I wanted to stop using Google services. In addition, iOS offered better security and privacy, and consistent OS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://merecivilian.com/my-advice-to-iphone-users-considering-a-move-to-android/&quot;&gt;MereCivilian&lt;/a&gt; recently switched to Android and offers some good advice for those who may be considering the switch. As I mentioned above, I stopped using Google services long ago and wouldn’t want to start again, which would be necessary with an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Switching blogging engines</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posted on December 3, 2024 by Loren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just read Jack Bay’s post &lt;a href=&quot;https://baty.net/2024/12/from-hugo-to-ghost-and-back-again/&quot;&gt;From Hugo to Ghost and back again&lt;/a&gt; about how often he switches up his blogging engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can hear you all giggling. Ha ha very funny, Jack changed his blog again. I get it. Most normal people don’t change blogging engines every month or two.[…] Also, and maybe most importantly, I prefer static websites. The arguments in favor of static websites are enough, but they aren’t why I want a static site. It &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; better having a static website. The actual publishing part can be a pain in the ass (:::cough::, Hugo) but the results are worth it. A folder full of HTML files and some images, starting on my local drive and synced to a simple web server…mmmmm, yummy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds me a bit of myself. You may have noticed that after switching this blog to a static site, I’ve moved it back to Bearblog and then back to static a couple of times over the last few weeks. Much like Jack, it just feels better to have a static website. I take pride in something I’ve built, and my content isn’t locked inside Bear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, I agree – publishing with a static site is a pain in the ass, but it’s worth the extra effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stop the constant switching, I decided to close my Bear account. In the end, this entire site is just a folder full of HTML files on my SSD, synced to GitHub and hosted on Netlify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey friends, I want to give a shout-out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://getdrafts.com/&quot;&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt;! It’s the best $20 bucks I spend every year. I first installed Drafts in 2014, when it was only available on iOS. Then, in 2019, Drafts came to the Mac. Drafts is my all-time favorite app and is where every bit of text starts: blog ideas, random thoughts, notes, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I have an idea or a thought, I immediately open Drafts and save it. It’s my go-to for quick note-taking. I use it to outline, draft, and format all my blog posts in Markdown. I keep everything organized with tags and workspaces. It’s also my personal information dump; with its amazing search, Drafts serves as my central repository for all the random bits of info I collect. On top of that, I’ve set up custom actions that let me do just about anything with my text: sending it to other apps, emailing it, saving it as a file, formatting it, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never tried Drafts, you gotta give it a try. There’s a free version to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Post December 11, 2024 by Loren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been thinking a lot about the state of healthcare in America in light of the murder of the United Healthcare CEO. I have hesitated writing about how I feel about this situation, but this morning, I read Dave Rogers, Nice Marmot &lt;a href=&quot;https://nice-marmot.net/Archives/2024/December_2024.html#note_2570&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about this very subject, so I thought I would say what I’m thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hadn’t given a great deal of thought to how I feel about the murder of that CEO. (I’m not mentioning his name mostly because I can’t recall it at the moment; but also because I don’t think he’s worthy of _“Say his name!”_respect.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trae Crowder is a stand-up comedian who has a YouTube channel called Liberal Redneck. I watch his videos because I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a laugh, and his are funny but also intelligent. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/aUcwZTWv2PY?si=ko0YNmGuWEo1KQfm&quot;&gt;I found this one particularly thought provoking&lt;/a&gt;, which is significant because I’d been kind of going out of my way &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to think about it. My reaction is that I don’t find much to disagree with in his comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before reading Dave’s post, I read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/what-the-murder-of-the-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-means-to-america&quot;&gt;New Yorker article&lt;/a&gt; by Jia Tolentino, “What the Murder of the United Healthcare C.E.O. Means to America&amp;quot; and I wanted to point out that United Healthcare denies 32% of insurance claims. Yep, nearly a third of claims submitted to this company are denied. That’s double the industry average, according to The New Yorker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Yorker quoted a person who posted on Reddit’s r/nurses forum, whose profile describes her as an I.C.U. nurse, wrote, &amp;quot;Honestly, I’m not wishing anyone harm, but when you’ve spent so much time and made so much money by increasing the suffering of the humanity around you, it’s hard for me to summon empathy that you died”. Thompson, who became C.E.O. in 2021, had raised annual profits from twelve billion dollars to sixteen billion dollars during his tenure. He received more than ten million dollars in compensation last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denying people the care they desperately need is fucking wrong and cruel. Yet, this level of corporate-driven harm has become so normalized in America that we barely blink at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m conflicted about the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <id>https://ldstephens.me/posts/re-digital-responsibilities/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posted on December 14, 2024 by Loren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently read &lt;a href=&quot;https://manuelmoreale.com/digital-responsibilities&quot;&gt;Manu&#39;s blog post&lt;/a&gt; about a post going viral on Hacker News. After being shared on Hacker News by someone, his website experienced a massive traffic spike that would make most website owners nervous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What caught my attention wasn&#39;t just the traffic surge but Manu&#39;s reflections on the broader question of online content sharing and the potential impact of sending unexpected waves of internet traffic to someone&#39;s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I’m wondering, if my site was big enough to cause problems, would then be my responsibility to be careful what I link to? Or should I just assume that other people out there know what they’re doing and I can keep linking without a second thought? My gut reaction tells me that it’s not really my responsibility to worry about the way other people run their sites but maybe I’m wrong and I should worry about that. &lt;strong&gt;I’d love to know what you think because this is one of those situations where I can see good arguments on both sides.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ldstephens is a static site that runs on Netlify’s Free Plan. Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;100 GB monthly bandwidth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 GB storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Progressive usage notifications at 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% of monthly limits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automatic site suspension if monthly limits are exceeded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick upgrade option to continue site availability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see a Hacker News viral moment could use up 100 GB of bandwidth fairly easily and could potentially suspend my site until the next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what Manu is asking is how I would feel if he shared one of my posts and it, for some reason, went viral and, exceeded my bandwidth limit and knocked my site offline. Would I feel that he had any responsibility? My answer is no. It’s my responsibility to manage my site, and he is welcome to share anything that I write, just as I’m sharing what he wrote in this post and responding to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple&#39;s unwanted 18.2 Mail makeover</title>

&lt;p&gt;I updated my iPhone to iOS 18.2 the other day and was pissed to find my Mail app hijacked by the categories and giant sender icons. I was more pissed that the update just forced these changes on me without even asking if I wanted these shitty&lt;a href=&quot;https://ldstephens.me/posts/apples-unwanted-182-mail-makeover#fn:1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After fucking around for a while, I figured out how to turn these annoying new features off and return to the Mail interface that’s worked perfectly fine forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable sender icons, follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Settings app on your iPhone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll down and tap “Apps”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find and tap “Mail”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locate the “Message List” section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toggle off the switch next to “Show Contact Photos”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disable categories, follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the Mail app on your iPhone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tap the “More” button (three dots) in the upper right corner of your inbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select “List View” from the pop-up menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posted on December 27, 2024 by Loren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in January, I wrote a post &lt;a href=&quot;https://ldstephens.me/posts/apples-vision-pro-who-actually-gives-a-shit&quot;&gt;Apple’s Vision Pro: Who actually gives a shit?&lt;/a&gt;. “Vision Pro? Who gives a shit, right? That’s probably what most folks on the sidewalk would say. And honestly, I get it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Lisa and I we went to the Apple store to buy her a new iPhone. It was my Christmas present to her. We traded in an iPhone 11 and purchased an iPhone 16 Pro. Considering the size of the crowd in the store, we were there for a little over two hours. That included purchasing the new phone, processing the trade-in, and the setting up of the new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vision Pro had its own table in the back corner of the store. I was keeping my eye on it because I was curious if anyone would go over and check it out. In the two-plus hours that we were in the store, not one person went to the table to check out the Vision Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was right. People just don’t give a shit about the Vision Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we are again - another year has flown by! They seem to go by faster and faster, and 2024 was no exception. It’s hard to believe we’re already in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I’m not one to dwell too much on the past, I will say that 2024 was a good year for Lisa and me. Looking ahead, my hope for 2025 is to continue living a healthy lifestyle and making the most of each day. I’ve got a couple of significant milestones coming up this year, which I’ll likely share more about when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year, and thank you for being a reader!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a long-standing position on politics: don’t make your politics my problem, and I won’t let mine become yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not saying that I don’t have strong political feelings because I do, but I am saying that I’m not interested in discussing that topic with anyone I wouldn’t hug. This seems to be the healthiest approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether I agree with or disagree with your politics, I don’t want to read about them. If you must write about them, I’ll remove you from my RSS feed. I agree with Sam. We all have political views, and as divided as we are over those views, the healthiest approach is to not fucking discuss them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posted on January 6, 2025 by Loren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using GitHub all wrong for this site. Instead of working from a cloned repository, I was just using a regular folder of files on my computer. Whenever I wanted to add a new post or make changes, I’d edit them in VS Code, then drag and drop the updated files directly into GitHub’s web interface. I knew this wasn’t the right way to do it, but I didn’t know any better. So, I started searching YouTube for a better way to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across this video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8rSLsi1xo&quot;&gt;GitHub Tutorial - Beginner’s Training Guide - YouTube&lt;/a&gt; that helped immensely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I needed to do was install GitHub Desktop and I needed to clone the repository locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now GitHub Desktop connects GitHub, my local repository, and VS Code together. Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting to GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;: GitHub Desktop links directly to my GitHub account, so I can easily clone repositories and sync my changes with the remote repositories on GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing My Local Repository&lt;/strong&gt;: When I clone a repository using GitHub Desktop, it creates a local copy on my computer. This is where I make changes and commit updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using Visual Studio Code (VS Code)&lt;/strong&gt;: I’ve set VS Code as my default editor in GitHub Desktop. When I click “Open in Visual Studio Code,” it opens my local repository in VS Code, ready for me to start coding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping Everything in Sync&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I write and edit my code in &lt;strong&gt;VS Code&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub Desktop tracks the changes I make and lets me commit them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once I’ve committed, I can push my changes to GitHub or pull updates from the remote repository when needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, taking the time to learn GitHub Desktop has made managing my static site so much easier. I can jump into VS Code to edit, track changes locally, and sync it all with GitHub in just a couple of clicks. It’s been a fucking game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I saved an article to &lt;a href=&quot;https://goodlinks.app/&quot;&gt;Goodlinks&lt;/a&gt; to read later. Today I decided to read it and discovered that the article is a 33 minute read. I didn’t want to take the time to read it right then, I thought that’s something that I would like to read on my Kindle Paperwhite while I’m in bed this evening&lt;a href=&quot;https://ldstephens.me/posts/send-articles-from-iphone-to-kindle-for-reading-later#fn1-27410&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;. The next question is how the hell do I get this article on my Kindle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was easy. I opened the article on my iPhone and saved it to my Kindle via the share sheet save to Kindle. I wrote this to share a helpful tip I didn’t know about myself. If you’re interested in doing the same thing, I hope you find it useful!&lt;/p&gt;

Well, you probably guessed blogging was not provided as an alternative—just more social media platforms. Look folks maybe it’s time to quit social media and start a blog.

&lt;p&gt;Hey friends, For the new year, I decided to clean up my iPhone&#39;s Home screen. While I&#39;ve been using just one screen for a while now, I wanted to give it a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I removed all apps from my Home screen except for those in the Dock. My plan was to only add back the apps I use most often. For everything else, I can just use Spotlight search or App Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s my Home Screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;macOS Sequoia introduces another new feature labelled Help Apple Improve Search, which sends and stores various search queries from Safari, Spotlight, and other sources to improve search results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature, too, is enabled by default and is well hidden at the very bottom of System Settings &amp;gt; Spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I had disabled this setting on my iPhone, and iPad but not on my Mac so I disabled it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And earlier this week, he announced that he has “&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/marklemley.bsky.social/post/3lfnpmxtam22r&quot;&gt;fired Meta as a client&lt;/a&gt;.” Lemley was representing Meta in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/11/a-bunch-of-authors-sue-openai-claiming-copyright-infringement-because-they-dont-understand-copyright/&quot;&gt;Kadrey v. Meta lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; regarding Meta’s use of books in training its AI. And, as the docket shows, on Monday, he withdrew as an attorney for Meta:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Lemley noted on various social media profiles, he cannot stomach what he sees as Zuckerberg’s embrace of nonsense and this is how he is responding to “Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook’s descent into toxic masculinity and Neo-Nazi madness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey friends, the other day, I was reading a blog post (wish I could remember whose!) about the indie web. It had several links, and I clicked one that took me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/&quot;&gt;indieweb.org&lt;/a&gt;. While browsing there, I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesg.blog/&quot;&gt;James’ Coffee Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really hooked me was James’ content. It’s a mix of tech and personal topics. I spent some time exploring his site and found tons of interesting articles to dive into. Needless to say, James’ Coffee Blog is now part of my RSS feed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not already following James, check out his site. I think you’ll find it worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something that I highlighted while reading one of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesg.blog/2025/01/15/static-dynamic/&quot;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a static site is significant to me because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static sites are fast (when engineered with performance in mind, of course!0. There is a significantly reduced admin tax. If my publishing tool goes down for any reason, my static site can still be available. I enjoy having folders of text files to edit: both markdown for posts and HTML for templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t agree more, static sites offer speed, simplicity, and the satisfaction of working directly with text files!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Checking analytics for ldstephens, it appears to receive relatively few direct page views. This can sometimes be discouraging. However, I must keep in mind that my target audience isn’t solely comprised of direct visitors but rather the 360+ RSS followers who are most likely to read my posts through their RSS reader app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posted on January 21, 2025 by Loren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey friends, I know many of you prefer mono fonts for writing and coding. I recently discovered a new mono-spaced font that you might be interested in. Macosguru &lt;a href=&quot;https://bicycleforyourmind.com/links%20of%20note%202025-01-21&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; about a new text editor he found and also mentioned that the app’s default font, Zed mono, was clean and well-designed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zed.dev/&quot;&gt;Zed&lt;/a&gt; is a new text editor which is built around the collaboration between humans and AI. I am not interested in that particular activity but it is an interesting addition to the world of text editors. It is snappy, clean, and modern. I don’t have a need for it, having immersed myself in Emacs. But if you are looking for an editor, I would give this a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about Zed. I loved the fonts that the editor uses as default. They have made them available.&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zed-industries/zed-fonts&quot;&gt;The Zed Mono and Sans typefaces, custom built from Iosevka&lt;/a&gt;. I can’t resist a free font, specially a well-designed, clean one. Get them to use in your editor of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Macosguru, I’m not interested in Zed’s text editor, but I did download the mono fonts. I’m currently typing this in MarkEdit using the Zed mono-spaced font, and I like it. I’m going to use it for a while and see if it sticks for me. Check out the Zed editor and Zed fonts for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You Can Build Your Own Static Blog - Here&#39;s How!</title>
    <link href="https://ldstephens.me/posts/you-can-build-your-own-static-blog-heres-how/" />
    <updated>2025-01-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://ldstephens.me/posts/you-can-build-your-own-static-blog-heres-how/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posted on January 24, 2025 by Loren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey friends, I bet a lot of you with a personal blog on platforms like Bear Blog, Pika, Write.as, have thought about building your own blog at some point. I know I was curious—until I finally decided to do for it! I didn’t have much knowledge of HTML or CSS, but I knew just enough to want to give it a shot. Plus, I figured I could use AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude to help me get started and tackle the stuff I didn’t know how to do. And the result? This blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve thought about creating your own blog too but felt overwhelmed by HTML, CSS, or all the technical details. Don’t worry, you’re not alone! The great news is that you can build a basic static blog site without needing a static site generator, the terminal, or advanced coding skills. With a little help from AI tools, it’s totally doable to create a site with an Atom feed for RSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s break it down step by step. I’ve asked ChatGPT for assistance with this task. The final outcome is a very basic, static blog that serves as a step-by-step guide to help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 1: Understand the Basics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving in, let’s get some quick definitions out of the way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static site&lt;/strong&gt;: A website that doesn’t require a database or fancy backend. Think of it as a collection of simple HTML files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atom feed&lt;/strong&gt;: A type of RSS feed that allows people to subscribe to your blog and get updates when you post new content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to be an expert at these. Just know that they’re essential to making a functional blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 2: Pick the Right Tools&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI can do a lot of the heavy lifting for you. Here are some tools you’ll use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Code Generators&lt;/strong&gt;: Platforms like ChatGPT can generate the HTML, CSS, and Atom feed for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Text Editor&lt;/strong&gt;: Use a simple editor like Visual Studio Code (free) to tweak the code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hosting Service&lt;/strong&gt;: GitHub Pages or Netlify are great free options for hosting your static blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 3: Create the CSS File&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by asking the AI to create a CSS file for your blog. Use this prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Create a CSS stylesheet for a blog with a header, main content area, and a footer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what the AI might generate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-css&quot;&gt;/* styles.css */
body {
   font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
   line-height: 1.6;
   margin: 0;
   padding: 0;
}

header {
   background: #333;
   color: #fff;
   padding: 1rem 0;
   text-align: center;
}

main {
   padding: 2rem;
   max-width: 800px;
   margin: 0 auto;
}

footer {
   background: #333;
   color: #fff;
   text-align: center;
   padding: 1rem 0;
}

nav a {
   margin: 0 1rem;
   text-decoration: none;
   color: #007bff;
}

nav a:hover {
   text-decoration: underline;
}

.blog-list {
   margin-top: 2rem;
}

.blog-list a {
   text-decoration: none;
   color: #007bff;
}

.blog-list a:hover {
   text-decoration: underline;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save this file as &lt;code&gt;styles.css&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 4: Link the CSS File in Your HTML&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, update your HTML files to reference the CSS file. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;viewport&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;My Blog&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;styles.css&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;header&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Welcome to My Blog&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;index.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;blog.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Blog&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
            This is the home page of my blog. Use the navigation to explore
            posts!
         &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;copy; 2025 My Blog&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save this file as &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;. It will serve as the homepage for your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 5: Create the Blog Page&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, ask the AI to generate a separate page for listing blog posts. Use this prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Create an HTML file for a blog page listing multiple posts with links to individual post pages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;viewport&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Blog&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;styles.css&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;header&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Blog&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;index.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;blog.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Blog&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;section class=&amp;quot;blog-list&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;Recent Posts&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;blog/post1.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Post 1&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;blog/post2.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Post 2&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;blog/post3.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Post 3&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/ul&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;copy; 2025 My Blog&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save this file as &lt;code&gt;blog.html&lt;/code&gt;. It will serve as the blog page for your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 6: Create Individual Blog Posts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each blog post, create a separate HTML file. Here’s an example for &lt;code&gt;post1.html&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html lang=&amp;quot;en&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;viewport&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;Post 1&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;../styles.css&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;header&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Post 1&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;../index.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;../blog.html&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Blog&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;main&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;article&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is the content of Post 1. Welcome to my first blog post!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;/article&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/main&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;copy; 2025 My Blog&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place this file in a &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; folder (e.g., &lt;code&gt;blog/post1.html&lt;/code&gt;). Repeat for each new post, updating the links in &lt;code&gt;blog.html&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 7: Create an Atom Feed&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask the AI to generate an Atom feed for your blog. Use this prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Create an Atom feed for a blog with multiple posts, each with its own link and publication date.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update the feed as needed when you add new posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 8: Host Your Blog&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have your files, it’s time to put them online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re using GitHub, create a new repository and upload your files. Go to the repository settings and enable GitHub Pages. Your blog will be live at &lt;code&gt;https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Netlify&lt;/strong&gt;: Drag and drop your files into Netlify, and it will instantly publish your site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Step 9: Update Your Blog&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you write a new post, you’ll need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a new HTML file for the post in the &lt;code&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Link it to the &lt;code&gt;blog.html&lt;/code&gt; page under the &amp;quot;Recent Posts&amp;quot; section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the &lt;code&gt;atom.xml&lt;/code&gt; feed with the new post details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload the updated files to your hosting service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a static blog doesn’t have to be complicated. With AI tools to generate code and free hosting platforms to get your site online, you can create a functional blog. Once it’s live, you’ll have your space to share your thoughts with the world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now I’m doing Yoga</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posted on January 25, 2025 by Loren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey friends, at 80, I like to think I’m pretty fit for my age. I’m 6 feet tall and weigh 165 pounds. Trix, our dog, and I walk 2 miles every single day, no exceptions. We’ve got a 10-acre property that keeps me plenty busy. In the winter, we heat the house with firewood I cut and split myself. I have a 35-ton log splitter that makes the job easier. Staying active is just who I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago I took a tumble down the basement stairs. Luckily I didn’t get hurt badly. A sore hip, sore back, and a gash on the palm of my left hand from attempting to catch myself. Oh yeah, my Apple Watch didn’t detect my fall. What the fuck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn’t my only fall over the last few years. As you age, poor balance becomes a concern, as the risk of falls increases. So with this last fall, Lisa insisted that I start doing Yoga that focuses on improving balance and core strength. So to get her off my back I agreed to start doing Yoga three times a week. Week one I realized how shitty my balance is. Week two I’m starting to see some slight improvement. Now on top of everything else that I do, I’m doing yoga three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blog setup flip-flop</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posted on January 29, 2025 by Loren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a bit of a rollercoaster when it came to my blog setup. I started the day with a plan after reading Herman’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://herman.bearblog.dev/manifesto/&quot;&gt;Bear Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; post: move ldstephens back to Bearblog. This change would reduce the friction associated with posting to a static site, and Bearblog would provide me with built-in analytics. Seemed like a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the afternoon, I tackled a necessary but tedious task in Bearblog—changing all the canonical links to alias and moved the DNS server setting to Bearblog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, plot twist! By the evening, I decided to move ldstephens back to Netlify. At the end of the day, I just love that I built this site myself. There’s something satisfying about knowing it&#39;s mine, running on my own setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after all that back and forth, I&#39;m right back where I started. But hey, sometimes you have to try something just to confirm that what you had was already the best fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I decided to replicate this site in 11ty as a learning project. The first thing I did was install Node.js. When I came to the 11ty install step, the install failed. After some additional attempts, I determined the problem might be the version of Node.js that I installed. So I uninstalled Node.js. Today, I’ll install a different version and start over.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posted on February 4, 2025 by Loren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I decided to change the layout and design of this blog. Since it&#39;s a static site running on Netlify, making changes isn&#39;t always smooth. And, of course, I ended up breaking the fucking site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, I had to point the DNS back to Bearblog, where I keep a duplicate version for moments like this when I inevitably mess up the static site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now (and maybe longer, depending on how things go), the blog is running on Bearblog until I get the new layout and design sorted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that was fun. The new layout and design are finally done, and everything is back up and running on Netlify where it belongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After breaking the site (because, of course, I did), we’re back in business.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posted on February 5, 2025 by Loren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instapaper.com/&quot;&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; was my go-to read-it-later app. Over the years it’s had a long and convoluted life some good and some not so good. During one of those not-so-good times, I switched to &lt;a href=&quot;https://goodlinks.app/&quot;&gt;Goodlinks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, Instapaper has been getting a lot of attention so every time the app gets updated I install it to test it out. Today I got an email from the developer announcing version 9.1 so I installed it and I’m using it in place for Goodlinks for the time being. One of the things that I like about Instapaper is the way it integrates with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reederapp.com/classic/&quot;&gt;Reeder Classic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if I’ll continue using Instapaper, but if I do, the free version is sufficient for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sleep Number vs. my snoring</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posted on February 6, 2025 by Loren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recently got a Sleep Number bed. I snore, which makes it difficult for Lisa to sleep. The bed has a snore setting that automatically adjusts its position to help reduce snoring. When activated, it gently raises the head of the bed by a few degrees to open airways and improve breathing. So when I snore, Lisa can adjust my side of the bed until I stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, when I woke up, I was surprised to find myself almost upright. Lisa said she kept adjusting the bed until I quit snoring–and that was the position when I finally stopped. At this rate, I might as well start sleeping in a recliner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, the Sleep Number bed has been wonderful for my lower back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>U.K. orders Apple to let it spy on users’ encrypted accounts</title>

    <id>https://ldstephens.me/posts/uk-orders-apple-to-let-it-spy-on-users-encrypted-accounts/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posted on February 7, 2025 by Loren&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/&quot;&gt;Joseph Menn, The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security officials in the United Kingdom have demanded that Apple create a back door allowing them to retrieve all the content any Apple user worldwide has uploaded to the cloud.[…] The British government’s undisclosed order, issued last month, requires blanket capability to view fully encrypted material, not merely assistance in cracking a specific account, and has no known precedent in major democracies.[…] Rather than break the security promises it made to its users everywhere, Apple is likely to stop offering encrypted storage in the U.K., the people said. Yet that concession would not fulfill the U.K. demand for backdoor access to the service in other countries, including the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is fucking crazy shit! If there’s a backdoor, hackers and cybercriminals will eventually find a way in, putting our security and privacy at serious risk. Our personal data could be stolen, leading to identity theft, financial fraud, and other attacks. It wouldn’t just be law enforcement using it—bad actors, including hackers and even foreign governments, could exploit the same weakness, violating users’ right to privacy and secure communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey friends, I know many of you who read my posts are in the U.K. You may have already read this. Quoting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/could-apple-pull-icloud-services-from-uk/&quot;&gt;Tim Hardwick, MacRumors&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;“A more dramatic response from Apple would involve completely removing iCloud services from the UK. While this would protect Apple&#39;s encryption standards, it would severely disrupt millions of UK users who rely on iCloud for photo storage, device backups, and document syncing. Users would need to find alternative cloud storage solutions and potentially lose access to years of accumulated data.”&lt;/em&gt; Are you concerned about this possibility?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feeding time around here is no joke! We go through 100 pounds of cracked corn every week to keep the deer and wild turkeys happy as they wander our 10-acre property. Our place is actually a Certified Wildlife Habitat with the state of New Jersey, and we love all the creatures that call it home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of that, we go through 40 pounds of birdseed for all the birds. Of course, the raccoon has figured out a little trick—every night, it climbs the tree, hangs off the bird feeder, and dumps the seed just so it can feast. Smart little guy! I haven’t spotted the groundhog yet this year, but I’m sure it’ll make an appearance soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James at James’ Coffee Blog created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesg.blog/2025/02/13/html-quiz&quot;&gt;fun quiz&lt;/a&gt; called “Which HTML element are you?” It has ten questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the quiz and “I’m the &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt; element! You’re great at gathering ideas from different sources and putting them together”.&lt;/p&gt;
