    <p>Posted on March 14, 2023 by Loren</p>
<p>On my walk the other day I was listening to John Gruber's <a href="https://overcast.fm/+B7NBTeKaY">The Talk Show podcast</a>. His guest was Jason Kottke who is celebrating the <a href="https://kottke.org/23/03/kottke-is-25-years-old-today">25th anniversary</a> of his blog.</p>
<p>John and Jason reminisced about the history of their blogs as well as the history of blogging in general. As I was listening I started thinking about my history of writing a blog and it goes something like this:</p>
<p>The name of my blog is simply ldstephens. The first two letters are my first and middle initials and then my last name. I choose this because the domain Stephens wasn't available so I picked an available variation.</p>
<p>When I decided to start a blog I knew that I wanted to blog about technology.</p>
<p>I published my very first blog post on Medium in September 2015. In August of 2016, I decided to start blogging as ldstephens and moved to WordPress so that I could have my domain (ldstephens.net), identity, and place on the web. At this point, I cross-posted most of my posts to Medium.</p>
<p>In 2021 I wanted to move away from WordPress and the block editor. I disliked the block editor because it took time to learn and get used to compared to the classic editor. It slowed down my editing process. I like writing content in markdown in one place and then posting it to WordPress, which is contrary to the block editor's “block” approach.</p>
<p>So in 2021, I decided it was time to leave the WordPress platform. After a fair amount of research on blogging platforms, I settled on write.as. I wanted to keep the ldstephens name and settled on the domain ldstephens.me. I published my first post here in December 2021 and I'm very happy here.</p>
<p>All that said I've been doing this going on 8 years. I love doing it and plan to be doing it for as long as I can type on a keyboard. I don't have a huge audience but the one that I do has been loyal and I thank you all for that.</p>
