    <p>Posted on October 15, 2024 by Loren</p>
<p>I've used the free version of BBEdit starting back when the free version was TextWrangler. The only thing I used it for up to now was for the occasional time that I needed to write something in a plain text editor. When I decided to build a blog using html and css, I decided to pay for the full version of <a href="https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a>.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://thejollyteapot.com/">Nicolas Magand</a>, now that I own the full version of BBEdit, I figured I should use it for writing markdown blog posts. Most markdown editors have keyboard shortcuts for bold, italic, and links, but not BBEdit. Since Nicolas switched from <a href="https://thejollyteapot.com/2024/09/27/the-wonderful-rabbit-hole-of-bbedit">MarkEdit to BBEdit</a> I figured he must have figured something out for this. And, of course, he had:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can share with you a zip of the some of the script I have added to the Script folder of BBEdit, and now these actions are available in the Script menu, and therefore can be configured with a shortcut in the settings. I’ve recycled a few that I found online (from Dr Drang, Gruber, and more), and they work great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as he said, they work great! Now, in addition to building my blog in BBEdit, I can also write my blog posts. (Shit, I have to figure out how to end a sentence with double space for the period. That is a hard fucking habit to break.)</p>
<p>Thank you for the help Nicolas!</p>
