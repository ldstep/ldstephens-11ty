    <h1 class='postTitle'>The Benefits of Personal Blogs Over Social Media Platforms</h1>

    
    
    
    <p>Posted on March 25, 2023 by Loren</p>
<p>I've never been a big fan of social media platforms. In fact, I've never had a Facebook account. I tried Instagram when it was first introduced but canceled it shortly thereafter since I'm not a photography buff.</p>
<p>I've had a Twitter account off and on since its inception. But honestly, I never found much value in it other than promoting my blog posts. Thanks to the shithead that now owns Twitter, I recently deleted my account again. Against my better judgment I just this week signed up for a new account only to promote my blog posts.</p>
<p>I was reluctant to sign up for a Mastodon account but I finally caved in a little over a month ago. Like Twitter I don't find much value in Mastodon so for now I'm going to keep my account but I won't be active other than to promote my blog posts.</p>
<p>What I find far better than social media are personal blogs. There are several benefits to following personal blogs rather than relying on social media platforms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Authenticity: Personal blogs are often more authentic than social media posts. Bloggers write longer posts and share more detailed stories about their lives or topics that interest them, allowing me to get a better sense of who they are as individuals.</li>
<li>Community: Many personal blogs have a strong community of readers and followers who engage with the blogger and each other. This creates a sense of belonging and connection that may not be as strong on social media platforms.</li>
<li>Longevity: Blog posts are usually archived and can be accessed at any time, whereas social media posts are often fleeting and get buried in a user's feed within hours or days.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, personal blogs provide me with a personalized, in-depth, and authentic experience that social media doesn't.</p>
