<p>Occasionally, there are times when you may want to convert an image to a PDF. There are several reasons why you might want to do this. Firstly, PDFs are easily shareable; you can send them via email, text message, or upload them online. Secondly, PDFs are more secure than image files, which can be easily edited or altered. Converting your photos to PDFs ensures that they remain unchanged. Finally, PDFs take up less space on your device than image files, which can help you free up storage space.</p>
<h4>Steps to Convert Photos to PDF on iPhone and iPad</h4>
