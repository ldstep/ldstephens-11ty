    <p>Posted on January 16, 2024 by Loren</p>
<p>Vision Pro? Who gives a shit, right? That's probably what most folks on the sidewalk would say. And honestly, I get it. Even knowing what this fancy new Apple gizmo is, I can't muster much excitement either. Maybe I'm just stuck in my old ways, but the idea of strapping a computer to my face just doesn't do it for me.</p>
<p>Let's face it, the Vision Pro ain't exactly chump change. It's like dropping a house payment on a glorified pair of goggles. For most folks, that's a tough pill to swallow. Sure, it might be cutting-edge tech and all, but for the average Joe, it's about as fucking practical as a new Lamborghini.</p>
<p>But hey, that's just me, the grumpy old tech geek. Perhaps there's a whole world of augmented reality magic waiting to be unlocked, hidden behind those sleek lenses. Maybe I'm missing out on the next big revolution in human-computer interaction.</p>
<p>So, yeah, for now, I'm content to keep my feet planted firmly in the present, with my trusty old iPhone glued to my hand and my face thankfully unencumbered by high-tech headgear. Maybe someday, the Vision Pro will win me over. But until then, I'll happily watch from the sidelines, waiting to see if this augmented reality dream turns into reality, or just another expensive fad gathering dust in a corner.</p>
