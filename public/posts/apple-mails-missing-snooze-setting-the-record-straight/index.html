    <p>Posted on September 26, 2023 by Loren</p>
<p>Fortunately, Apple’s built-in Mail app has become pretty feature complete over the years. Though the latest email features take a year or two to show up in Mail, most have made their way into the app — features like Send Later, Snooze, Undo Send, and more are now all in Apple’s default Mail app and available to all iPhone, iPad, and Mac users.</p>
<p>I use Apple Mail but I want to point out one misleading statement in this paragraph. Apple Mail does not have snooze! It's a feature that I wish it had. It does have Remind Me Later which is very different:</p>
<p><strong>Snoozed email</strong></p>
<p>Moves the email to a Snooze folder until the specified time. ￼The email is still visible in the Snooze folder, so you can easily find it and take action if needed. ￼If someone replies to a snoozed email, it will be un-snoozed and moved back to your inbox.</p>
<p><strong>Remind Me Later</strong></p>
<p>Creates a reminder for the email, but the email remains in your inbox. You can set a specific date and time for the reminder, or you can choose to be reminded at a later time, such as when you arrive at a specific location or when you complete another task. If someone replies to a reminded email, the reminder will remain active, but the email will be moved to the top of your inbox.</p>
<p>I find Remind Me Later to be useless.</p>
