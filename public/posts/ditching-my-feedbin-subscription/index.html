    <p>Posted on February 20, 2025 by Loren</p>
<p>For the last three years, I’ve been using Feedbin as the RSS sync engine for Reeder, my go-to feed reader. But last year, I let my Feedbin subscription expire. I knew iCloud sync in Reeder was pretty shitty from past experience, but I was hoping it had gotten better. It hadn’t!</p>
<p>After a few weeks of dealing with iCloud sync’s painfully slow performance in Reeder, I decided to try NetNewsWire with iCloud sync instead. NetNewsWire’s iCloud sync was almost as fast if not as fast as Feedbin. But since I still wanted to use Reeder, I caved and renewed my Feedbin subscription.</p>
<p>This year though, I’m not doing that again. Paying $50 a year to use Reeder doesn’t make sense anymore.</p>
<p>My Feedbin renewal is coming up in a couple of months, and I’ve made up my mind I’m not renewing. So today, I updated my feeds in NetNewsWire and started using it full-time. That way, by the time my Feedbin subscription expires, I’ll be comfortable with the switch.</p>
<p>No more paying extra just to use one app.</p>
