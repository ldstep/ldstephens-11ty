    <p>Posted on June 15, 2024 by Loren</p>
<p>Since the new iPads were introduced a couple of weeks ago there has been a lot of chatter about what one can and can't do on an iPad. One of the complaints I encountered was about not being able to set a default app to open certain file types in iPadOS. You know one of those posts about why someone can't use an iPad.</p>
<p>Well, there is a way sorta. Let's take a .txt file. The most common files that regular users have are .txt .md or .pdf. The last app to open a file type will be the default until you open it with a different app. Here's how it works:</p>
<p>For example, to change the default app that opens a .txt file on your iPad, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Files app and find the .txt file you want to change the default app for.</li>
<li>Tap and hold the .txt file until a menu appears, then select “Share.”</li>
<li>In the share sheet, you’ll see a list of apps that can open the .txt file. Choose the app you want to use.</li>
<li>The file will open in the selected app. From now on, whenever you open a .txt file, your iPad will remember this preference.</li>
</ol>
<p>My preference for .txt and .md files is to open in 1Writer and .pdf files to open in the default Preview in iPadOS.</p>
<p>Remember, iOS doesn’t have a universal way to set a default app for file types, but this method works for accessing files with your preferred app. This works the same way in iOS on iPhone.</p>
