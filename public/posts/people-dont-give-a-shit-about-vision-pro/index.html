<p>Back in January, I wrote a post <a href="https://ldstephens.me/posts/apples-vision-pro-who-actually-gives-a-shit">Apple’s Vision Pro: Who actually gives a shit?</a>. “Vision Pro? Who gives a shit, right? That’s probably what most folks on the sidewalk would say. And honestly, I get it.”</p>
<p>Yesterday, Lisa and I we went to the Apple store to buy her a new iPhone. It was my Christmas present to her. We traded in an iPhone 11 and purchased an iPhone 16 Pro. Considering the size of the crowd in the store, we were there for a little over two hours. That included purchasing the new phone, processing the trade-in, and the setting up of the new phone.</p>
<p>The Vision Pro had its own table in the back corner of the store. I was keeping my eye on it because I was curious if anyone would go over and check it out. In the two-plus hours that we were in the store, not one person went to the table to check out the Vision Pro.</p>
<p>So I was right. People just don’t give a shit about the Vision Pro.</p>
