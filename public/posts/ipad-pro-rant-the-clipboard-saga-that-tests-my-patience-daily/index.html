<p>Let me tell you something: I love my iPad Pro. It's a fantastic tool for reading, research, and even writing. But here's the deal: the lack of a decent clipboard manager makes me want to tear my fucking hair out.</p>
<p>Every. Single. Day. I'm copying and pasting things. Snippets from articles, research notes, half-written sentences. And yet, on the iPad Pro, it's an exercise in frustration. The measly one-item clipboard is a joke.</p>
<p>Sure, there are those workaround tactics <a href="https://ldstephens.me/conquer-the-clipboard-in-ipados-my-system-for-always-on-copying">that I wrote about</a> the other day, but let's call a spade a spade – they're just that, work-arounds. I get pissed when I start a task that demands copying and pasting; it's at that moment I reluctantly shift to my Mac. A move that shouldn't be necessary yet becomes an unavoidable ritual due to the iPad Pro's clipboard limitations.</p>
<p>Why should I be compelled to switch devices mid-stream just to manage a fundamental function like copy-pasting? This iPad Pro issue really bothers me, even though I enjoy using it. It deserves better, and it's high time Apple addressed this glaring shortcoming. Fix it please, Apple.</p>
