    <p>Posted on November 21, 2024 by Loren</p>
<p>In his Macworld article, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2525708">Jason Snell</a> makes a strong argument for why the Mac’s software ecosystem should be the model for iOS and iPadOS. Unlike iOS’s strict, App Store-only model, macOS has a more flexible approach to software distribution that has a balance between security and user freedom.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>App Store Apps: These are the most secure and Apple-approved, meeting strict standards. Macs can even be set to run only these apps, but it’s not the default.</li>
<li>Notarized Apps: Developers can distribute apps outside the App Store by submitting them for an automated Apple scan. These apps are safer than fully unverified software, as Apple’s cryptographic signature ensures they’re untampered and from known developers.</li>
<li>Non-Notarized Apps: These come with no Apple oversight, often from open-source or niche developers. While less secure, they’re still an option for users willing to take the risk.</li>
</ul>
<p>This system would let iOS and iPadOS users choose what they want without putting their safety at risk, just like Apple does on macOS.</p>
