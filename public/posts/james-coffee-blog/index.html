<p>Hey friends, the other day, I was reading a blog post (wish I could remember whose!) about the indie web. It had several links, and I clicked one that took me to <a href="https://indieweb.org/">indieweb.org</a>. While browsing there, I stumbled upon <a href="https://jamesg.blog/">James’ Coffee Blog</a>.</p>
<p>What really hooked me was James’ content. It’s a mix of tech and personal topics. I spent some time exploring his site and found tons of interesting articles to dive into. Needless to say, James’ Coffee Blog is now part of my RSS feed!</p>
<p>If you’re not already following James, check out his site. I think you’ll find it worthwhile.</p>
<p>This is something that I highlighted while reading one of his <a href="https://jamesg.blog/2025/01/15/static-dynamic/">posts</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having a static site is significant to me because:</p>
<p>Static sites are fast (when engineered with performance in mind, of course!0. There is a significantly reduced admin tax. If my publishing tool goes down for any reason, my static site can still be available. I enjoy having folders of text files to edit: both markdown for posts and HTML for templates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I couldn’t agree more, static sites offer speed, simplicity, and the satisfaction of working directly with text files!</p>
