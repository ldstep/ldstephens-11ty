<p>It's been a little over a month since we got our <a href="https://www.sleepnumber.com/categories/mattresses-innovation-series?tab=config">Sleep Number i8</a> bed. We needed a new mattress and had heard positive reviews about Sleep Number beds. They are known for improving sleep quality, reducing back pain, and alleviating snoring.</p>
<p>It's been a game changer for my lower back. Before, I'd wake up stiff and hunched over, but now I get out of bed feeling good. That alone makes the investment worthwhile.</p>
<p>The snore setting? Eh, not as impressive. It's supposed to adjust the bed to help with snoring, but we haven't noticed much difference.</p>
<p>Everything is controlled by the Sleep Number app on our iPhones. No messing with buttons or remotes, just open the app and adjust. The sleep tracking is a nice bonus, too. It gives solid stats on how well (or not) you slept, which has been interesting to see.</p>
<p>Overall, we're happy with it.</p>
