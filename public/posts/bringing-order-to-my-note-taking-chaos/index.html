    <p>Posted on April 4, 2024 by Loren</p>
<p>My note-taking system was a chaotic mess. Determined to get organized, I cleaned it up.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking Up with Apple Notes</strong></p>
<p>Apple Notes offered initial convenience, but exporting notes was limited to PDFs. I wanted the flexibility of having my notes in accessible files, not a closed-off database.</p>
<p><strong>Decluttering and Consolidation</strong></p>
<p>The first step involved a purge of obsolete and unused notes in Apple Notes, slashing the count from a 260 to 69. These remaining notes were then imported into my Obsidian vault, where they were merged with my existing note files. This consolidation means all my notes now reside as individual files within Finder.</p>
<p><strong>A Streamlined Filing System</strong></p>
<p>For optimal organization, all my files organized in Finder in 3 main folders:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>My File Cabinet:</strong> This folder is for all my critical documents.</li>
<li><strong>My Obsidian Vault:</strong> This folder houses all my notes and highlighted excerpts.</li>
<li><strong>Writing:</strong> This folder is a central repository for all my writing projects and archived material.</li>
</ul>
